MAD: Multi-Agent System Traces Dataset

A dataset of Multi-Agent System (MAS) execution traces annotated with the Multi-Agent Systems Failure Taxonomy (MAST). Each record provides details about the MAS, the Language Model (LLM) used, the benchmark task, a link to the raw trace file, and structured MAST failure annotations.
